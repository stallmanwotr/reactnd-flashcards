# readable-flashcards

_Flashcards_ is a React Native application that enables users to create decks of
flashcards to help with studying. Each deck can contain a number of cards, with
a question on one side and the answer on the back. A quiz can be started to test
the student's knowledge and report a percentage score.

This is project 3 of the Udacity React training course.

It uses [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to create the app
for mobile platforms (iOS and Android).


## Getting Started

This application requires that [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is installed, which provides
the `yarn` package manager command.

After installing `yarn`, install the application dependencies as follows:

<pre>
    $ yarn install
</pre>

And finally build and start the application itself:

<pre>
    $ yarn start
</pre>


## Installing Expo or a Simulator

_Flashcards_ can be run on a mobile device using the Expo app. This can be downloaded
from the Google Play store (for Android) or the App Store (iOS).

Alternatively, an Android or iOS simulator can be used. Follow the
[instructions here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
in the _Building Projects with Native Code_ tab.

## Notes:
* The app has only been tested for Android by running in Android Stuido (a Pixel 1
  virtual device).
* There is some initial test data loaded (2 decks), to make testing easier. It wouldn't
  be included if the app was officially released.
